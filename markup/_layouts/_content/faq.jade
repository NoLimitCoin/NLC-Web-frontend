                                p Using NLC2 instead of fiat currency allows the platform to navigate around restrictive sports betting laws in the United States and other countries around the world. This gives the platform a truly global reach that long-established competitors can only dream of.

                                p Put simply, fantasy sports is a way of betting on sports events that focus on the performances of players. The objective is to choose a squad of players you think will perform the best over a one week period, for the lowest amount of money. Your rewards are then determined by your chosen squad’s performance.
                                p Let’s say you’re playing fantasy soccer and you know who the most underrated striker in the Premier League is. You could include him in your squad for a bargain. If your chosen striker then scores the most goals in the league over a one week period, while other competitors’ highly rated yet expensive strikers floundered, you would gain an advantage over them in the competition, since you bet a lower amount but got more for your money.

                                p It's a currency rapidly appreciating in value, which cannot be said for many fiat currencies including the US dollar. Take a look at the adjacent graph charting the enormous growth in value of NLC2 this year.

                                p NLC2 Coins use a Proof of Stake algorithm for transmitting the blockchain. By staking your NLC2 Coins you become a node on the network that transmits the blockchain and you get 4% extra coins per year as your reward. The blockchain creates these new coins and sends them to your wallet. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5saLZQnEaA" target="_blank"> Watch our NLC2 Wallet Staking Tutorial Here for More Information </a>

                                p Currently, in the United States, the two biggest fantasy sports platforms are Draft Kings and Fan Duel.Together they own almost 90% of the US marketplace worth many billions of dollars. This effective monopoly has allowed them to charge their player's extortionate rates for using their platforms.
                                p The situation isn’t much different around the world in other countries, where a few large companies dominate the fantasy sports betting market.
                                p No Limit Fantasy Sports aims to provide players with far better rates than its competitors, ending the effective monopoly large fantasy sports betting platforms have over the marketplace.
                                p Rather than charging a 10% rake (cost for entering games), No Limit Fantasy Sports will charge a mere 5%! For head to head matches, this rake will be further reduced to 2.5% to make this platform by far the most competitive on the market!
                                p For those of you that aren’t familiar with betting these percentages might not sound dramatically different. But if you’re somebody that likes to play regularly, you’ll know full well that these percentages add up enormously over the long run.

                                p There are contests on established platforms such as Draft Kings where you can enter up to 500 squad choices. This allows people to use bots to effectively rig the competition in their favor while giving normal players almost no chance of competing. Betting in this way also results in emotional detachment from the outcome of any given game or any player’s performance.
                                p No Limit Fantasy Sports is a platform for purists. It will only allow players to enter a maximum of 10 squad choices. This will make the use of bots largely redundant, giving the average competitor a fair chance of winning. It will also force competitors to form an emotional attachment to their players and their performances, creating a more organic fantasy sports betting experience for all involved.
