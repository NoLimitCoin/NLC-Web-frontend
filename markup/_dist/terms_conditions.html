            <p><strong>(f) NoLimitCoin (NLC2).</strong> Every user is responsible to check local laws to determine how cryptocurrency is defined. NoLimitCoin or NLC2, is a crypto currency that trades publicly on multiple exchanges, may fluctuate in value significantly and the acquirer acknowledges the risk involved in partial or even total loss of value. A cryptocurrency is a digital medium of exchange that uses encryption to secure the processes involved in generating units and conducting transactions. Cryptocurrencies are a subset of digital currencies and, as such, have no physical representation.They may be used for online or in-person transactions with any vendors who accept them. In-person transactions using cryptocurrencies are typically conducted through mobile payment from a digital wallet. </p>
            <p>There are hundreds of cryptocurrencies around the world. Among them, Bitcoin is the most prominent example -- in fact, other cryptocurrencies are sometimes referred to as altcoins, as in alternatives to Bitcoin. The Bitcoin protocol enables peer-to-peer (P2P) exchange in a decentralized system that, unlike conventional currencies, is not associated with any financial institution or government. Bitcoin-to-Bitcoin transactions are conducted through anonymous, heavily encrypted hash codes across a peer-to-peer network. Each user’s digital wallet maintains their Bitcoins. The wallet also stores all addresses the user sends and receives Bitcoins from, along with a private key known only to the user. The P2P network monitors and verifies Bitcoin transfers. Other cryptocurrencies include Litecoin, Ethereum, and NoLimitCoin (NLC2).</p>
            <p>Each User shall be awarded ten (10) NLC2 when she or he opens an Account. In addition.

Nothing contained herein shall be construed to preclude any party from: (i) seeking injunctive relief in order to protect its rights pending an outcome in arbitration; and/or (ii) pursuing the matter in small claims court rather than arbitration. Although we may have a right to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses if we prevail in arbitration, we will not seek such an award from you unless the arbitrator determines that your claim was frivolous.</p>
            <p>To the extent permitted by law, you agree that you will not bring, join or participate in any class action lawsuit as to any claim, dispute or controversy that you may have against No Limit Fantasy Sports™ and/or its employees, officers, directors, members, representatives and/or assigns. You agree to the entry of injunctive relief to stop such a lawsuit or to remove you as a participant in the suit. You agree to pay the attorney’s fees and court costs that No Limit Fantasy Sports™ incurs in seeking such relief. This provision preventing you from bringing, joining or participating in class action lawsuits: (A) does not constitute a waiver of any of your rights or remedies to pursue a claim individually in binding arbitration as provided above; and (B) is an independent agreement. You may opt-out of these dispute resolution provisions by providing written notice of your decision within thirty (30) days of the date that you first access the Site.</p>
